special thanks to Metacrafters team for helping me in the course and project.
All the concepts required in this project were being learnt through the course provided by the Metacrafters team.
Welcome to the MetraCrafters repository! 
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that defines a basic token named "NaruCoin". 
Below, you'll find details about the contract, including its features, instructions, and usage.
Features:
    Token Details: Publicly accessible variables that store the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.
    Balances Mapping: A mapping that keeps track of each address's token balance.
    Mint Function: Increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address.
    Burn Function: Decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, with a check to ensure sufficient balance.

The contract is implemented in Solidity and includes the following key components:
Public Variables
    tokenName: The name of the token ("NaruCoin").
    tokenAbbrv: The abbreviation of the token ("Naruto").
    totalSupply: The total supply of tokens in existence.

Balances Mapping
    balances: A mapping from addresses to their respective token balances.

Mint Function
The mint function increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address.

Burn Function
The burn function decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, ensuring the balance is sufficient before performing the operation.
